# SR Tasks

This repository collects all the tasks which we want to work on.

Our tasks are often grouped into [projects](https://github.com/orgs/srobo/projects) for high level things we're working on.

You can also look at the full list of [issues](https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues) to see everything we're working on and what you can help with.
Issues are also grouped into [categories](https://studentrobotics.org/runbook/volunteering/tasks/#labels).

All our repos also have their own issues sections, which are used for more
specific things. The following repos are fairly easy to help out with, without
requiring too much specialist introduction:

 * [Competitor Documentation](https://github.com/srobo/docs)
 * [Website](https://github.com/srobo/website)
 * [Runbook](https://github.com/srobo/runbook) (how we organise ourselves)
