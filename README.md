# SR Tasks

This repository collects all the tasks which we want to work on.

Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues) page to see what we're working on and what you can help with.

All our repos also have their own issues sections, which are used for more
specific things. The following repos are fairly easy to help out with, without
requiring too much specialist introduction:

 * [Competitor Documentation](https://github.com/srobo/docs)
 * [Website](https://github.com/srobo/website)
 * [Runbook](https://github.com/srobo/runbook) (how we organise ourselves)
